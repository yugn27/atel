### What is metal touch sensor?
A metal touch sensor is a type of switch that only operates when it's touched by a charged body. It has a high-frequency transistor which can conduct electricity when receiving electromagnetic signals.

### How metal touch sensor works?
Touch the base electrode of a transistor with fingers to make it conduct electricity, for human body itself is a kind of conductor and an antenna that can receive electromagnetic waves in the air. These electromagnetic wave signals collected by human body are amplified by the transistor and processed by the comparator on the module to output steady signals.
