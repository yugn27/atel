# Create your design on your own
Have an idea and want to design it? We have a Powerful, yet simple 3D creation and editing tool with 3D printing support


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/02.png)


## So let’s Start with designing

Double click on Autodesk123d icon
 
Click on Start New project

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/03.png)


Click and hold your right mouse button and drag to rotate. To zoom you can scroll wheel forward and backward to zoom in and out

At top right corners is a cube that allows you to kind of align with specific directional attributes of your view  or (Realign your design).

Remember to set the proper units for the grid before creating objects.

Transform - move, rotate, scale or measure an object.
Move/Rotate – move or rotate selected object
Helpful hint – use this when you want to move an object in only one direction.
Smart Scale– adjust dimensions of an object by entering new values
Scale –magnify an object by a scale factor
Ruler – measure orthogonal distances from a ruler that is placed on the grid.

Primitives - create simple 3-D or 2-D shapes such as boxes, spheres, cylinders, cones, rectangles, circles, ellipses, etc

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/08.png)

Sketch - create or modify 2-D shapes.
o Once created, these shapes can be extruded or otherwise modified to create 3-D shapes

Construct - create new objects from existing 3-D or 2-D shapes.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/10.png)


Modify - modify existing 3-D objects
Press/Pull – resize part of an object with minimum distortion by moving a face of a solid
Tweak– distort or skew an object by moving a face or edge of a solid
Filet – create rounded edges
Chamfer – create flat, beveled edges
Shell – hollow out an object

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/11.png)

Pattern - create copies of an object
o  Alternate method: select an object, copy [Ctrl-c], paste [Ctrl-v], and then select & move it to the desired location

Grouping - combines objects without merging or subtracting material.
o  Helpful hint: This allows you to move complex drawings of multiple objects around the grid at the same time, rather than individually.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/13.png)

Combine - creates new objects out of combinations of existing objects.
Merge - combines all elements of objects selected.
Subtract - subtracts overlapping material.
Intersect - keeps only material that is overlapping.
Note: For the Subtract and
Intersect functions, be sure to properly select the source and target objects.

Text - places 2-D text on the grid.
o  Helpful hint: 2-D text can be extruded/modified into 3-D objects and then combined with existing objects.

Snap - places two objects next to each other based on the lines or surface areas selected for each object.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/16.png)

         
View - adjusts the view of the drawing.
Helpful hint: adjusting the view makes it easier to 1) properly measure distances between objects or 2) ensure objects are properly aligned before combining.
Home view - click on the house to put the drawing into its default view.
Pan- click and hold the left mouse button to slide the view back and forth.
Orbit- click and hold the left mouse button to rotate the drawing around any of its axes.
Alternative method: click and hold on the box while moving the mouse.
Zoom- changes magnification of current view.
Fit - automatically magnification to fit all objects into window.

Measure - measure the dimensions of a selected object or distances between edges of object(s).
The Face/Edge/Vertex Selection Type will measure line lengths, distances between lines/objects, or surface areas.
The Body Selection Type will measure volume of a selected object.
Note: 123D measures shortest distance between selected objects. Be sure to select the correct line or vertex to get orthogonal dimensions.
Example – the distance between the front of the car to the box is shown as 0.949 inches. However, when viewed from below, it’s clear that this is the shortest distance, not the down the centerline of the car.

When modifying an object (extruding, creating a pattern, etc), you have the option of merging, subtracting or intersecting material. Be sure to select the right option for what you are trying to do.
o  Click on the pull-down menu to the right of the toolbar. Select the appropriate action (merge, subtract, etc.)


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/19.png)
            
Create a filet or chamfer
o Select the appropriate action from the Modify toolbar. Click on the edge to filet or chamfer. Enter the desired filet radius / chamfer distance.

Shell an object
Select Shell from the
Modify toolbar. Click on the appropriate face of the desired object. Enter the desired thickness.
Helpful hints:
A minimum thickness of 0.1 inch is necessary for 3-D printing.
If you select the entire object rather than just one face when shelling, the object will be hollowed out like an eggshell, not shelled for 3-D printing.

Exporting a file for the Virtual Wind Tunnel.
When exporting a file, be sure to select the “Export as ASCII” box.
Note: The Virtual Wind Tunnel cannot analyze complex or shelled objects. Be sure to save a version of the car that is a solid object only.
