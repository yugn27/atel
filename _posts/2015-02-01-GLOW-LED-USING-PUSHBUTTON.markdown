Projects on breadboard
# GLOW LED USING PUSHBUTTON

### STEP 1: REQUIRED COMPONENTS
Push button switch
LED
220 Ohm Resistor
4 AA or AAA battery pack
Breadboard
Jumper wires (22 gauge)

### Step 2:
Attach the battery pack to the power and ground rails of the breadboard.
### Step 3:
Insert the LED with the anode (long leg) towards the top of the board.
### Step 4:
Insert the resistor into the board with one end in the same horizontal row as the LEDâ€™s cathode (short) leg and the other a few rows down. The resistor is not polarized so it does not matter which direction you insert it.
### Step 5:
Wire up the positive leads using red jumper wires. Then connect from the positive rail of the breadboard to the same horizontal row as the top leg of the switch. Now connect from the row that houses the bottom leg of the switch to the row that houses the anode of the LED.
### Step 6:
Wire up the ground lead from row that houses the bottom of the resistor to the ground rail of the breadboard. Check your work against the diagram below.
 
### STEP 7:

Press the button and the LED should light up.  Congratulations, you've assembled your first breadboard circuit.



# HOW TO MAKE LDR DARKNESS SENSOR CIRCUIT 

### STEP 1: REQUIRED COMPONENTS
1.LDR- 1
2.50 KOHM RESISTOR- 1
3.1 KOHM RESISTOR-1
4.BC547 Transistor
5.9v Battery

### STEP 2 : What is LDR?
LDR is a photoresistor is a light-controlled variable resistor.The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity,in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity.A photoresistor can be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and dark-activated switching circuits.
