# Wood Working
Wood working or carpentry is a skilled trade which is used for designing cutting processing of wood into different shapes and sizes according to the need.
Given below are carpentry tools which you will often come across while working in the lab:

Measuring tape and Pencil( Marker)

Hacksaw cutter
It consists of a fine toothed blade which is held by a C- Frame with a handle under tension. This cutter is usually used for cutting wood or metal.  
Safety Precaution:  Care should be taken while handling this tool due to sharpness.

These tools are used to provide finishing and to remove extra material. This also helps in smoothening the edges. 


Power screwdriver set

This is an electric screwdriver set which helps us in tightening of screws without the application of effort. Thus is easy to use.

How to use a cordless driller

Preparing to drill:
Wear safe clothing and eye protection

Wear ear protection if drilling regularly. A handheld electric drill produces about 90 decibels, which is just enough to cause hearing damage after prolonged exposure. Most cordless drills are quiet enough that hearing protection is not necessary.

Protect your lungs when necessary. If the project kicks up a lot of dust, wear breathing protection. A dust mask is only good for short-term comfort.

Choose the correct drill bit. Using a bit made from the wrong material can cause the bit or the material you're drilling to break. You can use a general-purpose bit on most wood; a masonry bit for stone, brick or concrete; an HSS (high speed steel) bit on most metals; and a carbide or diamond-tipped bit on very hard, brittle surfaces such as porcelain, glass, or glazed tiles.[3] There are many specialized bit designs, so consult the drill manual or bit manufacturer if you're not sure which bit to use.

Fit the drill bit firmly into the chuck. The chuck is the clamp in the "jaws" of the drill. This holds the drill bit in place as it spins. To replace a drill bit, make sure the drill is off (and unplugged if corded), then loosen the chuck by rotating it. Depending on the drill, you may be able to do this by hand, or you may need a chuck key located in a compartment in the top or handle of the drill.[5] Insert the drill bit into the chuck, then tighten again. Make sure the bit is straight and secure, and remove the key before you turn on the drill.

Clamp small pieces together. If you are drilling into a small, loose piece, clamp it down firmly before you drill. Do not hold the piece down with one hand while drilling, as the drill could slip and injure you.

Drilling Safety:

Drill a pilot hole. In many cases, you'll get better results if you start with a drill bit a little smaller than the final hole size. Drill a shallow "pilot hole," then switch to the larger bit to finish the job. The pilot hole will help prevent your drill bit from slipping, and reduces the chance of splitting wood or other damage.

Drill with steady pressure. Hold the drill steady and push it into the material you're drilling. If it takes more than light force to drill the hole, you're probably using the wrong bit.

Adjust the clutch. Each drill has a twistable collar to adjust the torque, often with a series of numbers on it. The higher the number, the more torque (rotational force) the drill will apply. If you are having trouble penetrating the material, increase the torque.

Avoid overheating the drill bit. If you are drilling through hard materials or drilling at high speeds, the drill bit will encounter an immense amount of friction. This can rapidly overheat the bit, to the point where it becomes red hot or burns the material you're drilling. Start at low drill speeds, and only increase the speed if the drill isn't moving smoothly. If you're drilling through hard materials, or drilling many holes in any material, stick to slow speeds and pause occasionally to give the bit a few seconds to cool down.
