# Wood Working
Wood working or carpentry is a skilled trade which is used for designing cutting processing of wood into different shapes and sizes according to the need.
Given below are carpentry tools which you will often come across while working in the lab:

### 1. Measuring tape and Pencil( Marker)

### 2. Wooden Glue

### 3. Hacksaw cutter
It consists of a fine toothed blade which is held by a C- Frame with a handle under tension. This cutter is usually used for cutting wood or metal.  
Safety Precaution:  Care should be taken while handling this tool due to sharpness.

### 4. Filer and Sandpaper

These tools are used to provide finishing and to remove extra material. This also helps in smoothening the edges. 


### 5. Power screwdriver set

This is an electric screwdriver set which helps us in tightening of screws without the application of effort. Thus is easy to use.

### 6. Cordless drill

# How to use a cordless driller

## Preparing to drill:
### 1. Wear safe clothing and eye protection

### 2. Wear ear protection if drilling regularly. A handheld electric drill produces about 90 decibels, which is just enough to cause hearing damage after prolonged exposure. Most cordless drills are quiet enough that hearing protection is not necessary.

### 3. Protect your lungs when necessary. If the project kicks up a lot of dust, wear breathing protection. A dust mask is only good for short-term comfort.

### 4. Choose the correct drill bit. Using a bit made from the wrong material can cause the bit or the material you're drilling to break. You can use a general-purpose bit on most wood; a masonry bit for stone, brick or concrete; an HSS (high speed steel) bit on most metals; and a carbide or diamond-tipped bit on very hard, brittle surfaces such as porcelain, glass, or glazed tiles.[3] There are many specialized bit designs, so consult the drill manual or bit manufacturer if you're not sure which bit to use.

### 5. Fit the drill bit firmly into the chuck. The chuck is the clamp in the "jaws" of the drill. This holds the drill bit in place as it spins. To replace a drill bit, make sure the drill is off (and unplugged if corded), then loosen the chuck by rotating it. Depending on the drill, you may be able to do this by hand, or you may need a chuck key located in a compartment in the top or handle of the drill.[5] Insert the drill bit into the chuck, then tighten again. Make sure the bit is straight and secure, and remove the key before you turn on the drill.

### 6. Clamp small pieces together. If you are drilling into a small, loose piece, clamp it down firmly before you drill. Do not hold the piece down with one hand while drilling, as the drill could slip and injure you.

## Drilling Safety:

### 1. Drill a pilot hole. In many cases, you'll get better results if you start with a drill bit a little smaller than the final hole size. Drill a shallow "pilot hole," then switch to the larger bit to finish the job. The pilot hole will help prevent your drill bit from slipping, and reduces the chance of splitting wood or other damage.

### 2. Drill with steady pressure. Hold the drill steady and push it into the material you're drilling. If it takes more than light force to drill the hole, you're probably using the wrong bit.

### 3. Adjust the clutch. Each drill has a twistable collar to adjust the torque, often with a series of numbers on it. The higher the number, the more torque (rotational force) the drill will apply. If you are having trouble penetrating the material, increase the torque.

### 4. Avoid overheating the drill bit. If you are drilling through hard materials or drilling at high speeds, the drill bit will encounter an immense amount of friction. This can rapidly overheat the bit, to the point where it becomes red hot or burns the material you're drilling. Start at low drill speeds, and only increase the speed if the drill isn't moving smoothly. If you're drilling through hard materials, or drilling many holes in any material, stick to slow speeds and pause occasionally to give the bit a few seconds to cool down.

# Examples

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/woodworking/examples/1.jpg)
## Wooden Buttons
hardwood branches
small hacksaw or table saw
fine-grit sandpaper
safety glasses
drill 
thin, sharp object or pencil
soft cloth or paper towel



## Materials which are to be used

### 1.Using the sharp tool or a pencil, mark 2 lines at a certain distance which will be the thickness of your button.

### 2.After making the markings, using a hacksaw cut along the markings.
### 3.Now, to drill the holes for sewing, use a drill machine with a drill bit of minimum diameter.
### 4.Drill 4 holes very carefully taking care that there is no stress produced on the button.  
### 5.Use the sandpaper to give finishing to the edges by removing the burr from the surfaces.

## Wooden stool

1  wooden plate with appropriate thickness.
Wooden Glue
Hand saw 
Drill
Pencil
Electric Screw driver set



### 1.Initially take a plywood.
### 2.Using a ruler and Pencil mark the required dimensions on the plywood.1 rectangular plate of dimensions say 50cm x 30 cm. 2 Square plates of 40cm x 40cm. 
### 3.Then, with the help of the hack saw blade cut the plate along the markings made.
### 4.With the help of filler and sandpaper file the edges thereby giving then finishing and removing the extra material. 
### 5.Now, join these plates. The structure which is to be made is as shown in the figure. 
### 6.The plates are first joined by the use glue so that a temporary structure is made.
### 7.After it is dried, with the use of power screw set drill the screws such that it holds the structure. 
If screws do not work you can also use nails and hammers.
### 8.After this finishing touches have to be given to the stool.

## Wooden Photo Frame.

The required tools and material are shown in the above image.
### 1.The first step is to decide the dimensions for the frame i.e. length and width of the structure.
### 2.After deciding the dimensions, on a wooden plate mark using pencil and ruler the length of the strips and the thickness of each strip.
### 3.Using a hacksaw blade cut along the dimensions. It is important to note that the edges of the strips have to be cut at an angle of 45Ëš for them to fit properly.

### 4.Then, with the help of the filer and sandpaper file the edger removing the extra material thereby smoothening the edges.
### 5.Now to hold the glass a secondary frame of larger length and width has to be made using a cardboard as shown in the figure.

### 6.Using Glue mount the edges together. When the glue has dried, gently hammer in a nail at each of the four corners to secure the pieces together. The nails should be driven into one sideof the frame, passing through one piece of wood and into the other, reaching as close to the midpoint of the wood as possible. 
### 7.They should also be placed perpendicular to the line of the joint.
### 8.Insert the glass.  Any clear plastic can work just as well as shown in the figure.

## You can now insert any picture. For the aesthetic looks you can colour the frame are carve designs.

Duster 
For this we require a wooden block of length 20cm.
Take a wooden bar and mark the dimensions using measuring tape/ ruler and a pencil.
Now using hacksaw blade cut the bar along the dimensions marked. Thickness of the duster depends on material availability and strength to be given.
Use filer to remove the material left after cutting and giving finishing.
After this cut a block of 2cm length which is going to be used to hold the duster,
Apply wood glue to the block of 2cm and place it on the duster.
The body of your duster is ready. Stick sponge or any other similar material which can be used to clean the blackboard.

*Points to remember
Use Vice to hold your work piece while cutting.
C-Clamp can be used to hold objects tightly together to prevent movement and separation.
Before using Electric screw driver set drill a pilot hole(which acts as a guide for the screw).
