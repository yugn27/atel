# What is FSR?
FSRs are sensors that allow you to detect physical pressure, squeezing and weight.

FSRs are basically a resistor that changes its resistive value (in ohms Ω) depending on how much it is pressed. These sensors are fairly low cost, and easy to use but they're rarely accurate. 
While FSRs can detect weight, they're a bad choice for detecting exactly how many pounds of weight are on them.
However, for most touch-sensitive applications like "has this been squeezed or pushed and about how much" they're a good deal for the money!

Even though there various types of force sensors, the force sensing resistors are having several advantages such as thin size (less than 0.5mm), very low cost and also good shock resistance. The only disadvantage of FSR sensors is low precision; there will be approximately 10% or more difference in measurement results.

### Force Sensor Resistor


# How does FSR Sensor Works?
The force sensing resistor is generally supplied as a polymer sheet or ink which is applied as screen printing. Both the electrically conducting and non-conducting particles are present on this sensing film. These particles are generally sub-micrometer sizes which are formulated for reducing the temperature dependence and also for improving mechanical properties, increasing surface durability.

### Force Sensing Resistor Layers

 
If force is applied to a surface of sensing film, then the particles touches the conducting electrodes and thus resistance of the film changes. There are several resistive based sensors but force sensing resistors operate satisfactorily in difficult environments and also require a simple interface compared to other resistive based sensors.
## Applications of Force Sensing Resistor
There are numerous applications for force sensing resistors in various fields such as foot pronation systems, automobiles like car sensors, resistive touch-pads, musical instruments, keypads, portable electronics, and so on.
