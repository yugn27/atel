# What is MQ -2 Sensor?
The MQ series of gas sensors use a small heater inside with an electro-chemical sensor. They are sensitive for a range of gasses and are used indoors at room temperature. The output is an analog signal and can be read with an analog input of the Arduino.

The MQ-2 Gas Sensor module is useful for gas leakage detecting in home and industry. It can detect LPG, i-butane, propane, methane, alcohol, hydrogen and smoke.
Some modules have a built-in variable resistor to adjust the sensitivity of the sensor.
Note: The sensor becomes very hot after a while, don't touch it!
# Pin configuration

Vcc : This pin powers the module, typically the operating voltage is +5V
Ground : Used to connect the module to system ground
Digital Out : You can also use this sensor to get digital output from this pin, by setting a threshold value using the potentiometer
Analog Out : This pin outputs 0-5V analog voltage based on the intensity of the gas

Vcc to Arduino 5V pin
GND to Arduino GND pin
Output to Arduino Analog A0 pin
### Step3: Code
const int gasPin = A0; //GAS sensor output pin to Arduino analog A0 pin
void setup()
{
 Serial.begin(9600); //Initialize serial port - 9600 bps
}
void loop()
{
Serial.println(analogRead(gasPin));
delay(1000); // Print value every 1 sec.
}
Step4: Observe the Result on Serial monitor.
