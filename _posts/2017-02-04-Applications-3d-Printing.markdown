# Applications of 3d printing

### Food
 Using robotic layer based food printing systems allows the recipe of the food to be digitized and saved in order to prepare very repeatable and high quality dishes without any margin for operator error. Also, the shape and decoration of the food can be individualized based on the customer or the occasion.

### Shelter
Conventional building methods are hazardous, time consuming, and expensive; 3D printing of buildings can enable automated creation of variety of buildings quickly and efficiently.

### Dental Implants
Direct and indirect 3D printing, namely printing the actual part or a mold, has been shown to be a cheaper and faster alternative to conventional techniques.

### Education
3D printing can revolutionize the learning experience by helping students interact with the subject matter. Students can create and fabricate their own design using this technology.
