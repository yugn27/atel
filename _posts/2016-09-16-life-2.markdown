# Basic measuring device (Digital Multimeter)
When you will come across the use of batteries and making of your circuits, you will face problems like battery failure , some circuit connection problems or just checking of the components. One solution to this problem is Digital Multimeter.
A multimeter is a handy tool that you use to measure electricity, just like you would use a ruler to measure distance, a stopwatch to measure time, or a scale to measure weight. The neat thing about a multimeter is that unlike a ruler, watch, or scale, it can measure different things — kind of like a multi-tool. Most multimeters have a knob on the front that lets you select what you want to measure. Below is a picture of a typical multimeter.

DMMs feature a digital or liquid crystal display (LCD), where measurement readings in exact numerical values appear. The display also alerts you to any pertinent symbols and warnings.
The dial of the DMM allows you to select the function you want to measure. Whether you intend to measure one of the three elements of Ohm's Law or a more advanced function like frequency or capacitance, you must first set the dial to the appropriate function.

# How to Measure DC Voltage with Multimeter:
## Step1: 
To measure a voltage the black test lead should be in COM slot and red lead should be in V slot.

## Step2: 
Now we have to select the Mode by using the regulator like knob in the centre of the multimeter. We should look for the DC voltage symbol (shown in picture below) and select a range under it. By default the range will be like 200mV, 2V, 20V, 200V and 600V. Based on the voltage level that you are planning to measure you can select the range
## Step3: 
Once we have set the meter we can simply place the probes on the terminals on which we have to measure the voltage. Place the red lead on the positive terminal and Black Lead on the Negative terminal and you will get the value of Voltage. If you reverse the polarity of the cable you will still get the value but it will be with a negative sign, always use the probes in correct polarity to avoid errors.

# How to Measure Resistance with Multimeter:
## Step1: 
To measure resistance with multimeter make sure the black probe is on the COM slot and the red probe in on the V slot.
## Step2:  
Now, turn the knob to the Resistance symbol. Again we have ranges from 200Ω to 2MΩ, select the one that you desire, You can always try different ranges to get the right range that suits for your resistor.

# How to Check Components using Diode Mode:
 
Another interesting mode in the multimeter is the Diode mode.  Ever wondered if the LED/Diode in your circuit is in working condition, or what color your LED might glow when powered! So lets check.
## Step1: 
Get your multimeter make sure your black probe is in the COM slot and the red probe is in the V slot 
## Step2: 
Adjust the regulator knob to the diode symbol as shown in the picture below.  The diode mode and the 2K mode resistance mode use the same place so don’t worry about it.

## Step3: 
Now place the Red probe on the Anode and the Black probe on the cathode of the LED and it should make the LED glow. This works because LED is also a form of diode, if you reverse the polarity the LED will not glow the same can be used to check the working of a diode.

# How to Check Continuity with Multimeter:
 
Another important and useful feature of a multimeter is checking for continuity. This is a life saver tool that helps to debug electronics, be it your new PCB or a simple breadboard connection you can use continuity tool to check if there a connection between two terminals. This can also be used to detect broken wire.
## Step1: 
The check for continuity of any wire or circuit, place the Black probe on the COM slot and the Red probe on the V slot, then turn the knob to the continuity symbol 
## Step2: 
To check continuity between terminals say terminal A and terminal B, place one probe (any probe) on terminal A and the other on Terminal B. If there is connection between terminal A and terminal B then the meter will read zero and you will also get a “beep” sound. If there is not connection you won’t get the beep sound.
