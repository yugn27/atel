# What is 3D printer?
3D Printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates a physical object from a digital design. There are different 3D printing technologies and materials you can print with, but all are based on the same principle: a digital model is turned into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer.

# How 3D printer works?
Every 3D print starts as a digital 3D design file – like a blueprint – for a physical object. Trying to print without a design file is like trying to print a document on a sheet of paper without a text file. This design file is sliced into thin layers which is then sent to the 3D printer.

From here on the printing process varies by technology, starting from desktop printers that melt a plastic material and lay it down onto a print platform to large industrial machines that use a laser to selectively melt metal powder at high temperatures. The printing can take hours to complete depending on the size, and the printed objects are often post-processed to reach the desired finish.
Available materials also vary by printer type, ranging from plastics to rubber, sandstone, metals and alloys - with more and more materials appearing on the market every year.


# Technology used:
### Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
The FDM printing process starts with a string of solid material called the filament. This line of filament is guided from a reel attached to the 3D printer to a heated nozzle inside of the 3D printer that melts the material. Once in a melted state, the material can be extruded on a specific and predetermined path created by the software on the computer. As the material is extruded as a layer of the object on this path, it instantly cools down and solidifies – providing the foundation for the next layer of material until the entire object is manufactured.

As the cheapest 3D printing technology on the market, FDM also offers a wide variety of plastic-based materials in a rainbow of colors including ABS, PLA, nylon and even more exotic material blends including carbon, bronze or wood.
FDM is a great choice for quick and low-cost prototyping and can be used for a wide variety of applications. More recent innovations in FDM 3D printing include the ability to manufacture functional end products with embedded electronics and mechanical parts such as drones. Due to some design and material limitations, FDM 3D printing is not recommended for more intricate designs.

# How can you get 3D printable designs?
Let’s start with the basics. To 3D print something, first you need a 3D model – the mathematical representation of any three-dimensional surface of an object. 3D models are created using computer-aided design (CAD) tools, various specialized software tools that simplify the design process on computers, tablets or even smartphones.

## So let’s Start with designing

Double click on Autodesk123d icon
 
Click on Start New project

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/03.png)


Click and hold your right mouse button and drag to rotate. To zoom you can scroll wheel forward and backward to zoom in and out

At top right corners is a cube that allows you to kind of align with specific directional attributes of your view  or (Realign your design).

Remember to set the proper units for the grid before creating objects.

Transform - move, rotate, scale or measure an object.
Move/Rotate – move or rotate selected object
Helpful hint – use this when you want to move an object in only one direction.
Smart Scale– adjust dimensions of an object by entering new values
Scale –magnify an object by a scale factor
Ruler – measure orthogonal distances from a ruler that is placed on the grid.

Primitives - create simple 3-D or 2-D shapes such as boxes, spheres, cylinders, cones, rectangles, circles, ellipses, etc

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/08.png)

Sketch - create or modify 2-D shapes.
o Once created, these shapes can be extruded or otherwise modified to create 3-D shapes

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/09.png)

Construct - create new objects from existing 3-D or 2-D shapes.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/10.png)


Modify - modify existing 3-D objects
Press/Pull – resize part of an object with minimum distortion by moving a face of a solid
Tweak– distort or skew an object by moving a face or edge of a solid
Filet – create rounded edges
Chamfer – create flat, beveled edges
Shell – hollow out an object

Pattern - create copies of an object
o  Alternate method: select an object, copy [Ctrl-c], paste [Ctrl-v], and then select & move it to the desired location

Grouping - combines objects without merging or subtracting material.
o  Helpful hint: This allows you to move complex drawings of multiple objects around the grid at the same time, rather than individually.

Combine - creates new objects out of combinations of existing objects.
Merge - combines all elements of objects selected.
Subtract - subtracts overlapping material.
Intersect - keeps only material that is overlapping.
Note: For the Subtract and
Intersect functions, be sure to properly select the source and target objects.

Text - places 2-D text on the grid.
o  Helpful hint: 2-D text can be extruded/modified into 3-D objects and then combined with existing objects.

Snap - places two objects next to each other based on the lines or surface areas selected for each object.

View - adjusts the view of the drawing.
Helpful hint: adjusting the view makes it easier to 1) properly measure distances between objects or 2) ensure objects are properly aligned before combining.
Home view - click on the house to put the drawing into its default view.
Pan- click and hold the left mouse button to slide the view back and forth.
Orbit- click and hold the left mouse button to rotate the drawing around any of its axes.
Alternative method: click and hold on the box while moving the mouse.
Zoom- changes magnification of current view.
Fit - automatically magnification to fit all objects into window.

Measure - measure the dimensions of a selected object or distances between edges of object(s).
The Face/Edge/Vertex Selection Type will measure line lengths, distances between lines/objects, or surface areas.
The Body Selection Type will measure volume of a selected object.
Note: 123D measures shortest distance between selected objects. Be sure to select the correct line or vertex to get orthogonal dimensions.
Example – the distance between the front of the car to the box is shown as 0.949 inches. However, when viewed from below, it’s clear that this is the shortest distance, not the down the centerline of the car.

When modifying an object (extruding, creating a pattern, etc), you have the option of merging, subtracting or intersecting material. Be sure to select the right option for what you are trying to do.
o  Click on the pull-down menu to the right of the toolbar. Select the appropriate action (merge, subtract, etc.)


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/design/2/19.png)
            
Create a filet or chamfer
o Select the appropriate action from the Modify toolbar. Click on the edge to filet or chamfer. Enter the desired filet radius / chamfer distance.

Shell an object
Select Shell from the
Modify toolbar. Click on the appropriate face of the desired object. Enter the desired thickness.
Helpful hints:
A minimum thickness of 0.1 inch is necessary for 3-D printing.
If you select the entire object rather than just one face when shelling, the object will be hollowed out like an eggshell, not shelled for 3-D printing.

Exporting a file for the Virtual Wind Tunnel.
When exporting a file, be sure to select the “Export as ASCII” box.
Note: The Virtual Wind Tunnel cannot analyze complex or shelled objects. Be sure to save a version of the car that is a solid object only.
