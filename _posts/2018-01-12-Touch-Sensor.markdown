# Touch Sensor
The sense of touch is an important sensory channel in many animals and some plants. Our senses inform to us when our hands touch something. Computer input devices are indifferent to human contact as there is no reaction from software in the event of making, maintaining or breaking physical contact like touches or releases. Thus, touch sensing input devices offers numerous possibilities for novel interaction techniques. Touch sensor technology is slowly replacing the mechanical objects like mouse and keyboard.

A touch sensor is a type of equipment that captures and records physical touch or embrace on a device and/or object. It enables a device or object to detect touch, typically by a human user or operator.
A touch sensor may also be called a touch detector.

A touch sensor primarily works when an object or individual gets in physical contact with it. Unlike a button or other more manual control, touch sensors are more sensitive, and are often able to respond differently to different kinds of touch, such as tapping, swiping and pinching. Touch sensors are used in consumer tech devices such as smart phones and tablet computers. Typically, touch sensors are used as a means to take input from the user. Each physical stroke that a touch sensor records is sent to a processing unit/software that processes it accordingly. For example, when navigating through a Smartphone or using an application, the touch sensor captures the human touches or the applied pressure across the screen. Each interaction with the user across the screen might have a different meaning for the device and/or the application.

 
# Touch Sensor Pin Outs:

Like a lot of the sensors out there, this is three pin sensors.  You provide power, ground and monitor the output.

# Connect the Touch Sensor to Your Arduino

This is a real simple set up.  You will know that you have power properly applied when the green LED is on.

# Let’s Make
## Shop from- http://technoventor.in/

## Touch to switch ON the light.
### Step1: Things you need
Arduino UNO
Capacitive touch sensor
Type A to B cable
Jumpers
LED

### Step2:  Connections with Arduino
It has 3 pins, VCC and GND for power and a SIG connection which you connect to your Arduino
The touch sensor is connected to D2 of the Arduino
 
Connect LED to pin 

### Step3: upload the sketch to Arduino
